    <property>
        <description>Whether to enable log aggregation. Log aggregation collects
        each container's logs and moves these logs onto a file-system, for e.g.
        HDFS, after the application completes. Users can configure the
        "yarn.nodemanager.remote-app-log-dir" and
        "yarn.nodemanager.remote-app-log-dir-suffix" properties to determine
        where these logs are moved to. Users can access the logs via the
        Application Timeline Server.
